Notes on what the program should do.

The levels should be randomly generated with an obious visual queue when the next level is generated.
Level differentiators include...
Faster gameplay.
Objects harder to kill.
Platforms further apart vertically and horizontally.


Gravity may not have to 100% accurate. COuld have the sprite travel up for a set period of time and then travel down for a set period of time (until they hit the ground/next object?).
